# Copilot
This plugin is a fork from the original [copilot](https://github.com/totalschaden/copilot), updated to work on PoE2.

Note that even though the plugin is a fork from the original, it has been rewritten and the handling of logic has been changed.
Also, there are features that I neither implemented nor plan to implement.

It used some of the base code from the [FollowLad](https://github.com/AlphaCaster/FollowLad).

## Features
- [x] Follow player
- [x] Go through portals
- [x] Use blink to catch up (if the target is getting far away)
- [x] Close UIs (like chests, crafting tables, etc) if accidentally clicked
- [ ] Pick up items
- [ ] Use skills

## Settings
The default settings were made to fit **MY** needs and may not work for you. So, please, don't open an issue if the plugin is not working for you because of the settings.

## Tips
- **DO NOT** use the checkpoints
- When the target goes through a portal, the target should wait, near, so when the bot loads he can see the target in his screen
- If you are going to fast it is your fault the bot is not working, not the plugin's fault
- It's nice to have the bot zoomed out with, [WheresMyZoomAt](https://github.com/doubleespressobro/WheresMyZoomAt-PoE2) plugin
- I recommend using the Waypoint and Map Device near each other

## Known bugs
- When going through the acts the bot will just stand still... FIX: [create new instance or go to another instance on the target](https://steelseries.com/pt-pt/blog/path-of-exile-2-how-to-reset-instance-1218).
